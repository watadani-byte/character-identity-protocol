# Character Identity Protocol

A governance framework for stabilizing character identity  
in probabilistic generative systems.  
Anchor-based control of problem reconstruction in generative AI.

## Core Innovation

Minimal prompt + converged solution image  
= Layer bypass + statistical convergence

Identity stability is achieved by anchoring the reconstruction layer,  
not by increasing prompt complexity.

## Validation

6 production case studies demonstrating:

- Identity preservation
- Cross-platform portability
- Recovery from collapse
- Professional character creation in ChatGPT

## Scope

This is NOT:

- A prompt template library
- A fine-tuning / LoRA method
- A model modification approach

This IS:

- An operational governance protocol
- A convergence control strategy
- A structured logging discipline

## Limitations

- Does not guarantee full determinism
- Requires disciplined operational control
- Designed for professional-grade workflows
