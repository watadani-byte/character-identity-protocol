# Three Applications of the Same Core Technology

## Core Principle

Control of problem reconstruction stage (A→A')  
through anchor-based constraint and formal validation gates.

---

## Application 1: Identity Preservation (Same Platform)

Maintaining character consistency across conversation turns.

**How it works**: Reference anchor injected each turn prevents free reconstruction.  
**Result**: Identity maintained indefinitely across complex operations.

---

## Application 2: Cross-Platform Portability

Migrating characters between platforms while preserving identity.

**Validated path**: Stable Diffusion → ChatGPT  
**How it works**: Anchor transfers with character; platform-agnostic by design.  
**Result**: Successful migration without manual trial-and-error.

---

## Application 3: Recovery from Identity Collapse

Detecting and reverting identity drift through rollback protocol.

**How it works**: Reconstruct from reference image anchor.  
**Result**: "Lost" characters recoverable without restarting from scratch.

## Key Finding

All three applications use identical technical foundation.

The anchor (minimal prompt + converged solution image) is the single mechanism  
enabling preservation, portability, and recovery.
